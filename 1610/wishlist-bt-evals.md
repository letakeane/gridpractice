### Common Themes
- can't break problem down, not sure where to start
- total blank page fail
- total blank on event objects and preventing default, struggle w/ what to right when I give direction using correct terminology
- no good pseudo practices
- not clear on whether they could/should/had jquery available
- no iterative debugging practices, don't leverage console to their advantage

### Anna
- Still in the red. Needs to break problems down more. Needs to try more shit out and test in the console. Takes hints very well. Could improve upon her upfront communication about what she plans to do. Struggles w/ syntax. Was able to figure out that she was not targeting class, but was not able to write it that way from the outset. 

### Breana
- Lack of understanding of what happens when git clone from GH to local. Slow on navigating tools/workflow. Started w/ wanting to set an event listener, which I think is good! Struggles w/ syntax. Was able to figure out that she was not targeting class, but was not able to write it that way from the outset. Can't answer questions about type of data she will have at any given step in her pseudo code. Missed hint/question around building html snippet and appending an element.
- She doesn't believe she can pass this mod right now, or in 2 weeks. She professes to be a slow learner, but says she has found people who can explain things the way she needs explained. She considers herself a "slow processor". She feels she has the pieces, but is struggling with how they all connect. Especially in "passing something like a loop to a function" (her words).

### Jon
- Had to explain the project to him. Total nervous wreck, but I'm also suspect he is clueless.
- Could not start on the code part either. Total blank and struggle about where to start w/ selecting an element from the dom.
- Major struggles w/ syntax. Total lack of grasp on terminology.
- Could not figure out to add eventlistener after storing input data into global
- very poor typing
- not good at communicating, doesn't consult docs unless I tell him to
- could not figure out he needed to pass a function for a group of code to the .on('click') piece
- no understanding of variables

### Chaz
- set up globals right away. incorrect class notation in jquery selector
- moved to eventlistener for submit button
- has the steps seemingly memorized, struggling with order to attack them
- no testing along the way
- when didn't work, he remembered "there is a default thing happening that i need..." - knows he needs it, but doesn't understand how it works or grok the concept of an event object.
- does not move at speed one would expect of repeating student at this juncture
- when asked about console, kept checking the elements tab in dev tools
- when asked about preventDefault, response was: 'in the code i've seen, that is run second'
- when asked what was smallest test he could run on the click handler to make sure it was hooked up 

### Kenia
- clear she is trying to pull from memorization of watching live code version
- needed a lot of hints/leading, but could take them well and figure out where she needed to go
- struggling with fundamentals

### Stephanie 
- mumbles outloud rather than communicate direction/thinking
- possibly a low yellow and not a red
- jumped to building a constructor function from rote memorization of ideabox
- went to build out the html snippet after I gave her some direction and build it in the index just to see what it would look like, which was GOOD
- was confused about appendChild for javascript vs. append in jQuery. 
- Doesn't consult docs enough, practically have to force her to do so, she will guess 100 times before reading a doc
- just barely managed to finish phase 1

### Chelle
- believed could assign a jquery selector with value of another jquery selector
- doesn't write enough code herself
- slow on the tools and sporadic navigation
