## Wish List
# Instructor: Bree
# Student: Devin Beliveau

- Struggles breaking down problem
- Struggles attacking a logical order. Pretty scattered, all over the place in terms of what she wants to do first.
- Doesn't understand basic directions like "assign a variable"
- Remembers almost nothing from past projects and doesn't take initiative to research
- Is constantly looking for the quick copy/paste option and trying to code from a rote memorization approach, rather than a meaningful understanding of how things are working
