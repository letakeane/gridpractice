## Wish List
# Instructor: Bree
# Student: Laura Allen

- She is actually decent at pseudo code with guidance, but suffers greatly from lack of confidence and "freak out"
- She was super struggling to start with the code part, so I let her pull up another project (she chose linked list)
- Has great difficulty in breaking problems down
- Great difficulty in following even her own pseudo code steps
- Major difficulty, inefficiency in navigating screens/windows/workflow
- Can't follow a variable through the various steps and understand it's value at any given time, or it's role in the function 

### JavaScript Style
* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand

### Progression/Completion
* 0: Developer is not able to implement basic functionality.

### Workflow
* 1: Developer gets work done, but wastes significant time or screen real estate

### Collaboration
* 0: Developer needs more than two reminders to "think out loud" or struggles to articulate their process
