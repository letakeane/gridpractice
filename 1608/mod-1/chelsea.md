Notes: seemed comfortable with material and using the tools appropriately. Was able to take direction well, used google effectively to supplement tips/suggestions, refactored thoughtfully when asked to but didn't refactor without the suggestion to. Got stuck a couple of times on syntax, but absorbed information quickly and seemed to retain it well. got a bit flustered when she got stuck, but got her composure back and collaborated well to get un-stuck.
