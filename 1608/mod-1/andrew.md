## Wish List
# Instructor: Louisa
# Student: Andrew

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

a little hesitant, got a bit stuck on concatination.

did a good job of breaking the problem into small parts, knew where he wanted to go, nerves got in the way a little bit.

overall, good job, seems on track. took direction/hints and ran with them well.

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
<!-- * 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice. -->

a soft 3. seemed a little nervous and moved a little bit slowly. in between apprentice and junior level. made pretty good progress in 15-20 mins.

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
<!-- * 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction -->

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
