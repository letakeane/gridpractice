# Wish List
## Instructor: Brenna
## Student: Hilary Lewis
## Notes:
Great attention to detail, has no trouble writing out functions and interpolating HTML syntax and writing event listeners. Hesitant to use shortcuts. Doesn't pull logic into separate components yet or consolidate repetitive code but understands how and why when discussed. Having some trouble with LocalStorage but that should ease up with a bit more exposure.

### JavaScript Style

* 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### Workflow

* 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
