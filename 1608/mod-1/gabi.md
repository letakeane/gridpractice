overall: very comfortable navigating around workspace. Has a very solid grasp of using tools/command line effectively and efficiently. got a little stuck on syntax a few times (a little ruby getting got tossed in there once or twice!), but correctly quickly when pointed in the right direction. used documentation effectively when needed. absorbed input very well, seemed to retain feedback very well.

a little quiet when communicating, but successfully talked me through her whole thought process. could work on feeling more comfortable/confidant on expressing what she's doing. she has good instincts and has a good handle on things, her opinion is very worth listening to and hearing!
