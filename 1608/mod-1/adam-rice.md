## Wish List
# Instructor: Bree
# Student: Adam Rice

- makes directory "mockproject1" for the project he is about to clone. not sure he understands the unnecessary nested directory structure he is creating.
- struggles moving around dev tools a bit and navigating macOS
- can't type jquery assigned to variable correctly
- wants to reference older projects for help, which I said was fine. He pulled up link-list.
- understands the $ for the variable is not required, but good for reminding of jquery object
- too much copying link list, so I made him stop and pseudo code "pseudo code the procedural steps to accomplish all the req's in phase1"
- starts w/ global variable naming: newItem var assigned to jquery element, and submit variable assigned to submit element (I made him stop here and test whether he thought he had what he said his assingment was)
- when asked to console log test ^^, he went straight to creating a submit.on(click) function with console.log inside.
- copies from other projects, but not inherent understanding of what is taking place in code
- confuses strings and variables like crazy


### JavaScript Style
* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand

### Progression/Completion
* 0: Developer is not able to implement basic functionality.

### Workflow
* 1: Developer gets work done, but wastes significant time or screen real estate

### Collaboration
* 0: Developer needs more than two reminders to "think out loud" or struggles to articulate their process
