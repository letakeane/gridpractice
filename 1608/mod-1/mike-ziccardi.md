## Wish List
# Instructor: Bree
# Student: Mike Ziccardi

- Much better at pseudo code writing!!
- When asked questions about variable assignment, he understood and made appropriate modifications w/out further explanation
- understands the bits much better than before (properties, functions, variables)
- SO.MUCH.IMPROVEMENT. (from my last 1:1 session with him)
- Things are starting to "click". I gave him a few sections/pages to study out of JS/jQuery Duckett book.

### JavaScript Style
* 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components

### Progression/Completion
* 1: Developer struggles to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

### Workflow
* 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction

### Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
