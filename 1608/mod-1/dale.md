## Wish List
# Instructor: Louisa
# Student: Dale

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
<!-- * 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components -->

soft 3 -- we didn't get very far into the implementation

### Progression/Completion

* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

very slow getting started. didn't get very far into implementing the solution

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
<!-- * 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction -->

was a soft 3 -- used tools, but still replied heavily on mouse.

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

Overall: I think the setup of the eval threw him off (I didn't let him reference old projects, only google/documentation), and he got off to a slow start in part I think to nerves. Moved very slowly getting started despite prompts to start writing the code and spent much time write pseudo code that ultimately didn't guide the process of solving the task at hand. struggled to break the steps down into small pieces and had trouble sticking to thinking about/working through the phases in order.
