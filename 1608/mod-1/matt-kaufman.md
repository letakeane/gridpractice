# Wish List
## Instructor: Brenna
## Student: Matt
## Notes:
Solid grasp of logical concepts and can quickly implement code functionality. Limited communication when making code decisions, even when prompted. Minimal to non-existent use of shortcuts. Speed of typing/implementation leads to smaller syntax errors that are easily overlooked. Strong forethought to refactoring and how to split code out into small chunks.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Progression/Completion
  - Only gave him roughly 20 min, got through iteration 2 well refactored.
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### Workflow

* 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
