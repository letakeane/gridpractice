# Final Assessment
## Instructor: Brenna
## Student: Maia Stone
## Notes: Some significant hesitation on concepts that should be solid muscle memory at this point, but with direction was able to pick back up and keep moving. Could conceptually answer questions about what lines of code were doing, but also seemed unclear on how variables were pulling out information from the DOM without prodding.
