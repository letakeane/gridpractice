### Evaluator: Bree
### Student: Ian Lancaster
### Notes: 
Very good job at collaborating on different ways and ideas to approach the problem. Solid understanding of what's going on in the code at all times, along with a strong grasp of terminology and ability to write without having to constantly look things up. One area of improvement, which will increase efficiency, is finishing the step you are on. You did not quite complete the function you were writing before moving onto the next one. The functions were coupled, and you were great at letting me know what you were doing, but efficiency and ability to keep things straight could be increased if you reigned in the "bouncing around". Again - not drastic, just a minor nitpick that is worth being cognizant, so it doesn't become a debilitating habit.
