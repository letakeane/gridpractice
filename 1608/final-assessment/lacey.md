# Final Assessment
## Instructor: Brenna
## Student: Lacey
## Notes: Zero hesitation breaking out functions into small pieces and with slight guidance quickly rearranged where functions were being called. Woudl like to hear more vocalization about where she was going next in her code, but with psuedocode was very well organized and had a good grasp on what code she wanted to write and why. Really really strong eval!
