# Module 2 Curriculum Goals

## Focus & Goals

### Technical Skills Goals:

* Fundamental JavaScript
  - Object Oriented Programming (encapsulation, inheritance)
  - Prototypal inheritance
  - ES6 features and syntax
  - Object prototype methods
  - Array prototype methods
  - Scope, `this`
  - Testing (unit and integration testing, test driven design principles)
  - React.js
  - Network requests and a soft introduction to asynchronous JavaScript
* Clear articulation of code
  - Good vocabulary
  - Attention to details
* Asking questions/for help
  - Understanding error messages
  - Timeboxing
  - Giving relevant context

### Professional Skills Goals:

* Process
  - Recognition and awareness of one's problem solving process and strategies
  - Development and implementation of new problem solving processes
* Growing independence
  - less dependence on instructors
  - more willingness to rely on documentation
  - seek out a mentor
  - more willingness to help others
* Organization & Communication
  - setting aside time for lesson review (not just project work all the time)
  - proactively setting up one-on-one pairing sessions and check-ins

## Role in Program

In Module 2, students begin to develop an understanding of how JavaScript is working under the hood. It is the module where we help them gain a nuanced understanding of code and conventions. They begin developing opinions, independence, and a conscious understanding of their own problem solving processes.

We focus on the importance of:
* taking risks
* making mistakes
* reading the docs
* testing their code
* timeboxing
* debugging
* asking for help
* working _productively_ (rather than just _harder_ or _more_)
* taking ownership of their learning

In Module 2, students begin to understand _why_ they are making various coding and problem solving choices, and _how_ the code is working. We hope that they start seeing how apparently unrelated concepts tie together (e.g. learning about `scope`, `this`, and `arrow functions`, and then seeing that understanding used in passing functions between React components). Instead of learning a lesson on DOM manipulation and then immediately using it in the next project, students must learn to take a longer perspective on the topics presented in Module 2.

## Expectations for Instructors

By the time they reach Module 2, students have generally only been coding for 7 weeks (if they repeated Mod 1, they will have been coding for 14 weeks). Their context and perspective is limited, and instructors should not make assumptions about student knowledge. It's always better to go over concepts very carefully and explicitly, working on establishing a solid foundation.

During lessons, check-ins, pairing sessions, and evals/assessments, instructors should exercise patience, cheerleading, and emotional support. At the same time, the curriculum-wide *Gradual Release of Responsibility* is in effect - students are expected to put in the necessary independent worktime to solidify concepts and skills that we introduce in lessons.

Lessons and projects are designed to emphasize the Mod 2 focuses: fundamental JavaScript, refining the problem solving process, and developing independence. During lessons, excellent ways to bring in those focuses:
* Give students time to work through an exercise (solo or in small groups)
  - Encourage journaling
  - Give time for solo reflection before group work
* Take time to discuss sticking points
  - "What was challenging?"
  - "What was your biggest hurdle?"
  - "What clicked?"
  - "What's still confusing?"
* Normalize struggle
* Model your problem solving process and the struggle
  - Whiteboard
  - Pseudocode
  - `debugger`
  - Reading documentation
  - Writing tests (TDD)

Recognize and reward student risk-taking and agency. Applaud questions. Push students to take ownership of their learning.
