# Weathrly

The project spec and rubric can be found [here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html).

## Project takeaways

The goal of Weathrly is to furnish students with an introductory understanding of React and consuming an API.

They should develop a familiarity with the following technical skills:
* React.js
* JSX
* Network requests using the `fetch` API
* testing React.js with Enzyme and Jest

and the following non-technical skills:
* refining their understanding of MVP
* improving pair workflow via code reviews
* articulating code

## Example Repos of Students Past

These are two high-quality examples of the Weathrly project from past students:

* [Katie Scruggs](https://github.com/katiescruggs/weathrly)
* [Melena Suliteanu](https://github.com/farmermel/weatherly)

## Check-in Conversations (optional)

The check-ins for Weathrly are informal and function more like pairing sessions to help get students unstuck.
* Open ended conversation for student questions
* Encourage whiteboarding/visualizing React Components
* Encourage good articulation of code with proper vocabulary
* Demonstrate process of turning high level concepts into code

## Evaluations

* Begin by using the app (5 minutes)
  - Is there a greeting page?
  - Is autocomplete hooked up?
  - Does the location persist on refresh?
  - Can a location be searched by zip code?
  - What happens when a nonsense location is searched for?
  - Are there bugs?
* Look through the code (10 minutes)
  - App Organization
    * Are the components logically divided up?
    * Do the components with state need to have state?
    * Are the components kept lightweight?
    * Are the network requests and API key kept in separate files?
  - JavaScript (JSX) Style
    * Has the developer made use of ES6 syntax?
    * Are props being leveraged and passed correctly?
    * Does the developer leverage conditional rendering?
    * Does the developer demonstrate an understanding of JSX?
  - CSS/Sass Style
    * Are the CSS rules organized in a consistent manner?
    * Is the CSS repetitive or efficient?
  - Testing & Sanitation
    * Is all functionality being tested?
    * Default state of stateful components?
    * Methods of components
    * Everything that updates properties (simulate user interactions, etc)
    * Is the linter finding any errors?
  - Workflow
    * Was a planning tool used? Trello, Waffle, GitHub issues?
    * Did the developers create wireframes when designing the app?
    * Do both developers feel they contributed meaningfully to the app?
  - Identify up to 3 things for the group to refactor
    * If any categories of the rubric is not passing, you can choose to offer an extension
    * Add GitHub issues of the suggested/required refactors
    * Depending on the scale of the refactor needed, you can set the deadline to the end of the day or the end of the week.
    * Be clear about the value/utility of doing the refactor
* Summarize any refactors needing to be done
* Point out strengths of the code - end on a positive note

Convention has been to give the groups their scores during the eval, with applicable areas "PENDING" until the requested refactors are submitted.
