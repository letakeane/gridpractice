# Sorting Suite

The project spec and rubric can be found [here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html).

## Project takeaways

The goal of Sorting Suite is to furnish students with an understanding of algorithmic thinking, ES6 syntax, and fundamental JavaScript.

They should develop a familiarity with the following technical skills:
* ES6 syntax (destructuring, spread operator, `let` & `const`)
* recursion
* refactoring
* testing

and the following non-technical skills:
* breaking down a complex problem into manageable pieces
* working with a large group
* synthesizing concepts into one's own understanding
* turning concepts into code
* articulating code

## Example Repos of Students Past

These are two high-quality examples of the Sorting Suite project from past students:

* [Katie Scruggs](https://github.com/katiescruggs/sorting-suite)
* [Melena Suliteanu](https://github.com/farmermel/sorting-suite)

## Check-in Conversations (optional)

The check-ins for Sorting Suite are informal and function more like pairing sessions to help get students unstuck.
* Open ended conversation for student questions
* Encourage whiteboarding/visualizing the sorting algorithms
* Encourage good articulation of code with proper vocabulary
* Demonstrate process of turning high level concepts into code
* Emphasize algorithmic thinking

## Evaluations

* Flip a coin, or have the students pick odds or evens (1 minute)
  - Determine which sort (merge or quick) will be demonstrated with cards, and which will be live coded
* Have student demonstrate two sorts with playing cards (5 minutes)
  - Insertion sort
  - Whichever sort (determined above) will be demonstrated
* Have the student open an empty repl.it page and live code the remaining algorithm  (10 minutes)
  - Begin with pseudo code
  - Observe the logic the student uses
  - At end, discuss places where ES6 syntax could dry up the code
* Run the test suite (5 minutes)
  - Discuss the importance of semantic descriptions
  - Discuss testing hooks (beforeEach)
  - Discuss test utilities (random array generator, etc)
  - Discuss how code should stress test the sorts and reveal which ones are more efficient

Do code reviews on their repos, to be completed and returned to them by the following Monday.
