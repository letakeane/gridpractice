# Personal Project

## Description

The personal project is an opportunity for the students to show off what they've
learned, and build something they are excited about. For students who've
struggled with the concepts in the previous projects, it's an opportunity to get
some deeper experience with something they may not have fully understood the
first time around.

## Learning goals

- Mastery of the required technologies
- Experience working with a 'client' to meet external and shifting expectations

## Required technologies

- React
- Redux
- Router
- Some API (student's choice)

## Optional (extension) technologies

- Sagas/Thunks (encouraged)
- Express.js
- Knex
- Postgres
- Firebase
- Any number of others, depending on what the student is hoping to build

## Common student pitfalls

- Students will often pick a project that is too big for the amount of time they
  have. It's important to remind students at the outset they will only have
  about two weeks.
- Studens, by their second check in, may be obviously behind the pace necessary
  to deliver the app they've initially envisioned. At this point, it's
  important, as the instructor (client) to help them iterated to something that
  meets the learning goals.
