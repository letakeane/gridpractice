## Common student pitfalls

- Students often struggle with setting up Postgresql. We've tried to mitigate
  this by switching to the Postgresql app, but it's still critical that they
  have any distributions of Postgresql uninstalled from their machines before
  starting.
- Occasionally students try to set up their project in the same repo as the
  server, they shouldn't do this.
