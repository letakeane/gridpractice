# Headcount

## Description

Headcount is designed to give the students some more exposure to React, and more
experience writing fundamental JavaScript. Essentially, the project requires the
students to write code to parse/analyze a dataset of Colorado school district 
data, and then display this information on the page using React best practices.

## Learning goals

* Make small, reuseable React components
* Use stateless/stateful components appropriately
* Get experience testing react components using:
    - Jest snapshots for UI
    - Enzyme shallow mounting for testing instance methods

## Required technologies

- React
- Jest
- Enzyme

## Optional (extension) technologies

n/a

## Common student pitfalls

- Students sometimes don't appreciate how much work this will require, and don't
  spend enough time identifying time to pair with their team
- Students don't always take advantage of the React lifecycle, and put API calls
  (not real API, they are just making a helper) outside of componentDidMount

## ToDo's

* [ ] move test folder into src and update import paths
