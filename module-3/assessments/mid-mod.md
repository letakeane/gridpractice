# Mid Mod Eval

## Description

At the end of Week 3 of the module, we pair with the students for their mid mod
evaluation. This involves building an 'idea box' like application, that creates
fun events, and saves them to a backend. The students are given two repositories
to start with, and are asked to build an app that submits fun events to the
backend, and displays them on the page.

## Expertise evaluated

- React fundamentals
  - Can correctly identify when to create stateful/stateless components
  - Can create a controlled form component
    - Value should be from state
    - Change should be handled with state change
  - Can pass props effectively (data down, actions up)
- Async fundamentals
  - Can use fetch to POST data to a server
  - Can use fetch to GET data from a server
- Ability to leverage documentation when stuck
- Ability to actively communicate thinking
