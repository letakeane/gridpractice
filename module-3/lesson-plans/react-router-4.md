# React Router 4

## Description

Prior to this lesson, the students are really only building applications where
the entire app sits inside of the App component. Router allows them to take a
step towards building larger applications, by separating application logic into
sensible routes. Ultimately this allows them to start building applications more
like the ones they're familiar with from around the web.

## Learning Goals

  - Understand differences between Router/BrowserRouter
  - Using Route component
    - component prop
