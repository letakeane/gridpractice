# Async JavaScript with Promises

## Description

This lesson introduces the students to asynchronous concepts in JavaScript,
giving them their first expousre (that they're aware of), to Promises. In
explaining this, we touch on the JavaScript runtime, and give them a base
understanding of the Stack, Queue, Heap, and event loop.

  level.
- Be able to provide an example of asynchronous code, and how the stack and the
  queue play into this
- Be able to discuss the problems that arise from using callbacks instead of
  Promises
- Be able to create and resolve a promise
