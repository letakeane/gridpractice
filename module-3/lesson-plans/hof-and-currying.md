# Higher Order Functions and Currying

## Description

This lesson is in preparation of the introduction of Redux. Redux leverages
Higher Order Functions to connect React components to the store. Not having seen
this behavior before can be confusing for the students, so this lesson serves as
a bridge.

## Learning goals

- What is Currying
- What is a higher order function (HOF)

## Process

- Take 5 minutes
  - How would you define a Higher Order Function?
  - How would you define a curry?
- What does it mean that JavaScript functions are first class citizens?
  - Talk about functions as objects, and parameters
  - Where are you already using functions as parameters?
- Repl.it example
- When might we use this? 
  - Redux
  - Event handling
- NinjaCurry
  - Have the group work on the first problem ~15 minutes, then do a show and
    tell with 2-3 people
  - Have the group work on the second problem ~15 minutes, then do a show and
    tell with 2-3 people

## Context

Redux' connect function is the first exposure the group has to a function that
returns another function, this lesson helps reduce the confusion around that.
