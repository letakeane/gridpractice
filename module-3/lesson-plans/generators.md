# Generators

## Description

In Javascript, generator functions are specialized functions that can be
entered, exited, and then re-entered, while maintaining context. They're most
powerful when paired with aysnchronous operations like fetching data. The most
common place where are students are likely to encounter them are with
redux-sagas, so this lesson serves as a prequel to that one.
