# Ideabox

## Description

This is traditionally the first lesson of the module, and is intended as a
refresher for the students. Generally, we spend some time going over the
critical terms/concepts surrounding React, before whiteboarding what our mini
ideabox application will look like, and ultimately building it in a live code
environment. For the livecode session, we bootstrap the application using
create-react-app.

## Learning goals

- Refresher on React
- Why we use statefull components
- Why we use stateless components
- How we pass data down
  - What we mean by 'data'
- How we pass actions up
  - What we mean by 'actions'
- How to use create-react-app

## Process

1) What is our application going to look like? What are the critical components
  - App
  - Form
  - CardContainer
  - Card(s)
2) Are these components going to be stateful or stateless? Why
  - Turn and talk
3) We say that in React "Data down, actions up", what do we mean by this?
4) Bootstrap an app with create-react-app
5) Give a quick tour of what this boilerplate gives you
6) We have an App already, what state will this have?
  - Ideas
7) Build out the form component
  - We call this a controlled form component
  - What will the state of our form be?
    - title
    - description
  - How will we handle changes in the form inputs?
    - onChange
  - How will we handle the form submission?
    - onSubmit
8) Lets talk about binding
  - Take 5 minutes, and read whatever docs you can find
    - What does it mean for a function to be 'bound'
    - How do we bind a function to the class in JavaScript?
