Final Evaluation: Scrabble
Student: Kris Foss
Instructor: Brenna
Notes: CRUSHED IT. Confident when writing react syntax, actively pulls out logic into small functions both in javascript and react syntax. Is comfortable writing ES6 syntax directly in render function but swiftly pulls it out when necessary. Incorporates dependencies like lodash and ES6 fluidly for well refactored and intentional javascript. Only criticism is a hesitation to vocalize if confused or stuck - which was rare!
